## Tools

My father was a tool maker. He made tools for other tradespeople to use, and I remember as a little kid the look of accomplishment in his eyes when he had made something that another builder could use.

In this module, we're going to setup our tools of the trade. We'll keep it simple and focus on just the minimum things we need to get programming.

In the future you'll come to love the tools you use and choose them with great care. Or perhaps like my father, you'll see limitations in the tools that you're using and want to build your own. That will come later.

For now we're just going to use some common tools that make the task of instructing a computer easy to do.
