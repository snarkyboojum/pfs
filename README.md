# Python from scratch (Pfs)

## Introduction

Welcome to the best, most original Python course on the internets, Python from scratch (or Pfs for short)! This course will take you from __zero__ to a point where you can bend a computer to your will and make it do exactly what you want, all in Python 3.

Of course, you won't know all the things after you've finished this course, but what you will know is all the fundamentals required to be completely self-sufficient so that you can learn whatever else you need to on your own. Your journey to become an expert programmer will have then truly begun, and it's a lifelong journey.

After finishing Pfs, you will understand:

* The foundations of how programs operate and run on a computer
* How to write simple programs that you talk to in a terminal or command prompt
* How to read and write data to your computer
* How to retrieve information from the internet and work with it
* How to visualise that information and gain insights from it
* How to interact with application programming interfaces (API)

This course will take you approximately 30 hours to complete, which would take about 3-4 months if you spend 2 hours a week working through it.

Good luck, and for any questions or improvements please send a pull request with your suggestions.
